Bash Game - Class Project

This is a simple game created in Bash as a class project. The purpose of the game is to provide a fun and interactive experience for users to play a game using Bash commands.

How to play:

    Go to the directory where you have downloaded the file.

    Open a terminal in the directory.

    Execute the game file by typing:

    bash bash-game.sh

    Select a map by typing the number 1, 2, or 3.

    Move the cursor using the WASD keys.

As this is the first version of the game, there are only a few maps available. The game is designed to include a timer and a leaderboard, and I am currently working on implementing these features.
